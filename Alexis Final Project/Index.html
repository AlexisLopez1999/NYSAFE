        <h2>HOW  TO ENSURE SAFETY</h2>
        <ul>Speed Bumps</ul>
        <ul>Installing more signs(ex.Stop signs)</ul>
        <ul>Slower top speed(slowing the speed of cars in the city)</ul>
        <ul> Always look left,right again before crossing the street.</ul>
        <ul>retiming traffic signals</ul>
        <p>The city isn't always to be safe. It's dangerous. In New York City, the greatest drop in traffic fatalities last year (2016) involved people who were riding in motor vehicles; the number fell to 48 deaths, from 59 in 2015. Motorcyclist deaths also dropped last year to 19, from 22 in 2015.</p>
